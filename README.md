    text = """US actor Jussie Smollett has been sentenced to 150 days in jail after a jury found he lied to police about being the victim of a hate crime.

    The former Empire star, 39, was found guilty in December of five charges of felony disorderly conduct after making false reports about the hoax attack.

    The sentence also includes 30 months of probation and $145,000 (Â£110,000) in restitution and fines.

    Following the sentence, Smollett said: "I did not do this!"

    The trial stemmed from an incident three years ago when Smollett said he was attacked by two assailants.

    The actor, who is black and gay, said the attackers shouted slurs at him and a Trump slogan, dumped a "chemical substance" on him and tied a noose around his neck while he was walking late at night in January 2019."""

    words = ["lean", "thought", "mean", "flower", "yeast", "vehicle", "feel", "broadcast", "dreamed", "resources"]
